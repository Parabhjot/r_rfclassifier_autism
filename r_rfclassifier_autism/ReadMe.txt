I am a senior data analyst aspiring to become a data scientist.  

I wrote this script to practice writing some machine learning algorithms in R (I learned mostly in Python). It's quite simple writing similar algorithms in R. 

The reason for choosing this dataset is because my wife is a Behaviour Therapist working with Children with Autism. She tells me a lot about her work and it always interests me. When I came across this dataset, I thought it would be a great opportunity to apply some of what I know to my wife's profession.  

Please let me know what you think of my Rmd reporting structure and whether you have any suggestions to improve my model.
